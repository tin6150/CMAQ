# each command a new docker layer as hash, 
# chain command using && will reduce layer (and more compact image if there are clean up across layers)
# layer that does not change will not be re-downloaded in a pull, but it is still rebuild.
# but to have different image, need diff Dockerfile and tag accordingly
# to save build time, need separate Dockerfile/image that does not change in the lower layers
