TMP README
~~~~~~~~~~

This is my attempt to build CMAQ 5.2.1 in a container.
does not yet work.


Original README.md from CMAQ from EPA/CMAS is at README.orig.md


Model from Lucas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lucas wrote a model that Ling/Huy are running.  He has a couple of papers.
supplement said to have source code:
https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/8363/2019/acp-19-8363-2019-supplement.zip
	see TMP/ for such extract
	need to compare against /global/home/groups-sw/pc_adjoint/CMAQ-4.5-ADJ-LAJB_tutorial/code/CMAQ-4.5-ADJ-LAJB

if can't find latest from github, then maybe better off get code from Ling...
just copy into my forked CMAQ repo, and code would be avail then.
